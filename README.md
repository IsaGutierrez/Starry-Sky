# âœ¨Starry Sky

Starry Sky is a relaxed, cute point-and-click game where you'll have to collect coins, bunnies and lunar bugs to earn points.

You'll have to click on the objectives before they disappear from the screen, or else you'll loose lives. Coins do not disappear, so make sure that there are no more than 5 coins at the same time or it'll be game over.
